Restoring the full AACT database

1) Download the zip file with the most recent AACT datadump - usually provided on a daily basis
2) Unzip the file and store the postgres.dmp file in a suitable folder
3) Create the 'aact' DB if not already created
4) Open a command window and navigate to the Postgres bin folder - on a Windows machine this is C:\program files\postgresql\17\bin
(This is where pg_restore.exe is to be found. Alternatively ensure the location is added to the Path variable)
5) Ensure access to the DB is available by setting up a pgpass text file, if one is not already present. 
This contains the user credentials and removes the need to include the password in the restore command.  (see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html)
For a Windows machine: This file must be called pgpass.conf and should be in the AppData\Roaming\PostgreSQL folder of the current server user, i.e. normally 'admin' 
on a server, not the postgres user, (which is usually 'postgres'). 
On a Linux machine: states the file is .pgpass and should be in the user's home directory and subject to security restrictions (not tested) - see PG documentation link above.
The file has a host:port:database:user:password pattern, but include a * wildcard as the database name.
e.g.
# host:port:database:user:password
localhost:5433:*:<user name>:<password>

6) Run the following command:

*** first time use

 pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -p 5433 -e -v -O -x -d aact --no-owner "E:\MDR source data\CTG Dumps\20250318\postgres.dmp"
 
 where 
 -h: Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running. The default is taken from the PGHOST environment variable, if set.
 -U: User name to connect as.
 -p: Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is listening for connections. 
	Defaults to the PGPORT environment variable, if set, or a compiled-in default.
 -e: Exit if an error is encountered while sending SQL commands to the database. The default is to continue and to display a count of errors at the end of the restoration.
 -v: Specifies verbose mode. This will cause pg_restore to output detailed object comments and start/stop times to the output file, and progress messages to standard error. 
 -O: =  --no-owner. Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match the original database. 
	 By default, pg_restore issues ALTER OWNER or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION statements to set ownership of created schema elements. 
	 These statements will fail unless the initial connection to the database is made by a superuser (or the same user that owns 
	 all of the objects in the script). With -O, any user name can be used for the initial connection, and this user will own all the created objects.
 -x: Prevent restoration of access privileges (grant/revoke commands).
 -d  database name, 'aact' in this case
 --no-owner: Duplicate of -O (??)
 <full file path> to postgres.dmp file
 
 
  *** subsequent use, replace existing database
  
Despite the 'clean' flag in the command below, any existing ctgov schema in the aact db must first be deleted., or the command below exits with an error about the schema already existing.
  
 pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -p 5433  -e -v -O -x -d aact --clean --no-owner "E:\MDR source data\CTG Dumps\20250318\postgres.dmp"
 
where
-clean: Before restoring database objects, issue commands to DROP all the objects that will be restored. 
This option is useful for overwriting an existing database. If any of the objects do not exist in the destination database, 
ignorable error messages will be reported, unless --if-exists is also specified.
