Restoring the full AACT database

1) Download the zip file with the most recent AACT datadump - usually provided on a daily basis
2) Unzip the file and store the postgres.dmp file in a suitable folder
3) Create the 'aact' DB if not already created
4) Ensure access to the DB is available by setting up a pgpass text file, if one is not already present. 
This contains the user credentials and removes the need to include the password in the restore command.  (see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html).
The file has lines with a host:port:database:user:password pattern, but include a * wildcard as the database name, e.g. 
# host:port:database:user:password
localhost:5432:*:<user name>:<password>
4a) On a Linux machine: the file is called .pgpass and should be in the user's home directory and subject to security restrictions (0600) - see PG documentation link above.
4b) On a Windows machine: This file must be called pgpass.conf and should be in the AppData\Roaming\PostgreSQL folder of the current server user, i.e. normally 'admin' 
on a server, not the postgres user, (which is usually 'postgres'). 
5a) On a Linux machine Postgress installation should normally have inserted pg_restore in a folder listed within the PATH (e.g. /usr/bin, but actual location may 
vary between distros). Check this is the case (modify PATH is necessary), and open a console window.
5b) On a Windows machine folder may be in the path but if not open a command window and navigate to the Postgres bin folder - this is C:\program files\postgresql\17\bin.

On initial download of the aact file...
6a) On a Linux machine ensure that the current user can access both the database and the downloaded postgres.dmp file. One way is to modify the postgres.hba_conf file to allow all local users to 
access the PG server cluster, e.g. as trusted users. As the default PG authentication scheme appears to be 'peer' for local users, an easier approach is to create a PG super user with the same name
as the OS admin user (i.e. the account established at OS install). The best approach may vary depending on previous changes to the postgres.hba_conf file.
Assuming an OS sudo name and PG superuser name of 'fred' run

pg_restore -e -v -O -x -d aact --no-owner -U fred '/home/steve/Data/MDR source data/CTGDumps/20250318/postgres.dmp'

where the path to the postgres.dmp file needs to match the actual path.

6b) On a Windows machine run the following command:

pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -e -v -O -x -d aact --no-owner "E:\MDR source data\CTG Dumps\20250318\postgres.dmp"
 
where the path to the postgres.dmp file needs to match the actual path, and the pgpass file provides the password.

In both cases
 -h: Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running. The default is taken from the PGHOST environment variable, if set.
 -U: User name to connect as.
 -p: Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is listening for connections. 
	Defaults to the PGPORT environment variable, if set, or a compiled-in default. If the port is the default 5432, therefore, it need not be included in the command.
 -e: Exit if an error is encountered while sending SQL commands to the database. The default is to continue and to display a count of errors at the end of the restoration.
 -v: Specifies verbose mode. This will cause pg_restore to output detailed object comments and start/stop times to the output file, and progress messages to standard error. 
 -O: =  --no-owner. Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match the original database. 
	 By default, pg_restore issues ALTER OWNER or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION statements to set ownership of created schema elements. 
	 These statements will fail unless the initial connection to the database is made by a superuser (or the same user that owns 
	 all of the objects in the script). With -O, any user name can be used for the initial connection, and this user will own all the created objects.
 -x: Prevent restoration of access privileges (grant/revoke commands).
 -d  database name, 'aact' in this case
 --no-owner: Duplicate of -O (??)
 <full file path> to postgres.dmp file
 
  
 *** for subsequent use, i.e. to replace an existing database schema

The simplest approach appears to be to do a CASCADE DELETE on the ctgov schema in the aact database, and simply repeat the steps described above.
Although the AACT documentation describes a slightly different process, adding the '--clean' flag to the command above, this does not appear to work - the restore ends with an error
about the schema already existing.
